# Feature Changelogs

Per-feature changelogs for large, multi-PR features. The main project changelog is in the repo root: **CHANGELOG.md** (generated by standard-version).

## Adding a feature changelog

1. Copy `_template.md` to `<feature-name>.md` (e.g. `morpho-integration.md`).
2. Fill in Status, Overview, Changes, etc.
3. Use the same scope in your commits as the derived scope from the feature name (e.g. `morpho-integration` → scope `morphointegration` → use `feat(morphointegration): ...` in commits).
4. Refresh the **Commits** section with:

   ```bash
   npx ts-node scripts/update-feature-changelog.ts <feature-name>
   ```

   Example: `npx ts-node scripts/update-feature-changelog.ts morpho-integration`

The script finds commits whose message contains the scope in parentheses (e.g. `(morphointegration)`) and replaces the `## Commits` section with a bullet list.
