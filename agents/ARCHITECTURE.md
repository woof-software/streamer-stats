# Architecture details

This file extends the **Architecture Principles** in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) with project-specific or deeper architecture documentation.

## What belongs here

- **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)** — summaries of important structural or technology choices.
- **Dependency diagrams** — high-level module/package dependencies.
- **Deployment and runtime** — how the app is deployed, scaled, and observed.

## In this foundation repo

This repository is a foundation only (no application). For the standard Woof DeFi backend architecture (vertical slices, layering, dependency flow), see [AGENTS.md — Architecture Principles](AGENTS.md#architecture-principles).

When you create a new project from this foundation, add ADRs and diagrams here as you make significant architecture decisions.
