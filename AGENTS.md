# AI agent instructions

This repository is a **foundation** for Woof Software DeFi backend projects. It does not contain application code—only tooling, workflows, and AI agent documentation.

- **Full agent instructions:** [agents/AGENTS.md](agents/AGENTS.md) — architecture, structure, module development, patterns.
- **Code conventions:** [agents/CONVENTIONS.md](agents/CONVENTIONS.md) — style, naming, TypeScript, NestJS, DeFi.

**Using this foundation for a new project:** Copy the `agents/` folder (and optionally `.github/`, `.husky/`, `scripts/`, config files) into your new repo so AI agents and developers have the same standards.
